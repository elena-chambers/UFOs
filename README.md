# UFOs

## Overview
A client has complied a list of ~100 alien sightings in a javascript file. The purpose of this project is to create a dynamic webpage whereby filters on the date, city, state, country, or shape of sighting can be filtered and displayed in a visually appealing table.  
Steps used complete project:
- Build and deploy JavaScript functions, including built-in functions.
- Convert JavaScript functions to arrow functions.
- Build and deploy forEach (JavaScript for loop).
- Create, populate, and dynamically filter a table using JavaScript and HTML

#### Resources
- Data: data.js
- Software: Python 3.8.8, Visual Studio Code, 1.60.2

## Results
The final webpage (screenshot below) can be accessed at https://elena-chambers.github.io/UFOs/
To perform a search, type in queries using the format in the placeholder spaces (ie use lower case, check spelling, etc.)

## Summary
The webpage is functional, however there is room for improvement. It would be useful to utilize regex filtering functions such that case and spelling sensitivity in the filter inputs could be better inferred or understood if a typo was introduced. Additionally, the data set has a very small set of dates that have sightings, and it would be useful to create a drop-down menu so that users could immediately see what dates have data, or pull data that is most recent to their realative searches.
